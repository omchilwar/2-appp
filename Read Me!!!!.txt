Hey! It's Malice.

Thanks for choosing to use my Smooth Editing Pack. I think you're going to love it!

I want to make sure you get the most out of it so I made you a full tutorial for how to do exactly that:

You'll learn how each preset works, common bug fixes, as well as how you can use these presets while becoming MORE creative!

Hope you enjoy it brother, happy editing!
